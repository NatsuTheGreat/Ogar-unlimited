To Install Ogar Unlimited, you need [Node.js](nodejs.org)

(To install Node.js for linux simply do this `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodes` Then do this `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`)

(You can install and use Ogar unlimited on windows very quickly. First click `InstallWSForNoobs.bat` in src. then wait (it takes awhile) then click `ClickToStartForNoobs.bat` and your off! the next time you start the server, you only have to click `ClickToStartForNoobs.bat`)

First download the repository and unzip it or do `git clone https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited.git`

Then locate the folder `Ogar-unlimited` by using `cd [directorypath]` in commandprompt/terminal

Do `npm install` to install ws ( a needed plugin )

Then `cd` it to `Ogar-unlimited/src`

Type in `sudo node index.js` It might require your password. (Note: this will not work if you are not using a root/administrator user)

Then connect by typing `agar.io/?ip=localhost:443`

If you want to connect with your friends, you need to port forward

P.s. did you know you can go to your server in iOS? To do that, go to the agar.io/?=yourip website on safari then click do not open in App Store. Then go to the upload button next to the url input and click request desktop site.
